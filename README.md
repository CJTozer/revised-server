# *re*VIS*ed* Server

* Server code providing the data API for [reVISed](https://github.com/CJTozer/revised#readme).
* Written in Go.
* API running [here](https://revised-server.herokuapp.com).

## Development

* Use `govendor fetch ...` to get new dependencies - this saves untangling the dependency chain later when you were inadvertently relying on globally-installed packages.
